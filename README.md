## Project Description
"GuessTheNumberByIvelinaIvanova" is a console-based game implemented in Java. The game challenges players to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number. It offers progressively increasing difficulty with each level.

## Features
- Generates a random number within a predefined range.
- Provides feedback on player guesses (too high, too low).
- Progresses through multiple levels, expanding the range of possible numbers.
- Utilizes concepts of loops, conditional statements, and user input/output.

## Technologies Used
- Java programming language
